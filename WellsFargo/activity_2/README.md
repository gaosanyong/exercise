Write a utility named comparer_builder that creates a functor that defines arbitrary search order.

Below gives an example workflow. Notice that some test data is integrated with the .cpp file. Please remove them before using the class elsewhere.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./comparer_builder
```
